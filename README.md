# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
This project aims to factorize numerous numbers into a product of two smaller ones. While it performs admirably in this regard, it encounters challenges when dealing with bignums (numbers larger than long long unsigned integers). Any contributions towards enhancing the project's compatibility with bignums would be greatly valued.
